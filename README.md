# Tic Tac Toe Flutter

A **Player vs CPU** Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Flutter, following strict **Clean Architecture** principles.  
The project serves as a reference implementation showcasing state management with Riverpod, declarative navigation with AutoRoute, local persistence with Drift, and continuous code quality with SonarCloud.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Player profiles** | Create and switch between multiple player profiles, persisted via SharedPreferences |
| **Difficulty levels** | Easy / Medium / Hard CPU opponent powered by a Minimax algorithm |
| **Game board** | Animated 3×3 board with winning line highlight |
| **Game history** | Browse all past games, sorted by date — with a confirmation-gated "clear all" action |
| **Move replay** | Step-by-step replay of any recorded game |
| **Internationalization** | French 🇫🇷 and English 🇬🇧 supported via ARB files |

## Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture** with a strict feature-first folder structure.

### Dependency rule

`presentation` → `domain` ← `data`

Repository interfaces live in `domain/`, concrete implementations in `data/`.  
Pure game rules that are shared across features (`BoardRules`) live in `core/domain/` to avoid cross-feature imports.

### Domain logic on entities

State transitions that depend only on `GameState` are extension methods on the entity itself, keeping the notifier as an orchestrator only:

| Method | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `GameState.canPlayerMove(int)` | Guard: is the human allowed to play here? |
| `GameState.withMove(int, String)` | Pure state transition: apply a move |
| `GameState.evaluate()` | Determine won / draw / still playing |

---

## Tech stack

| Concern | Package |
| --- | --- |
| State management | `flutter_riverpod` + `riverpod_generator` |
| Navigation | `auto_route` + `auto_route_generator` |
| Local DB | `drift` + `drift_flutter` |
| Preferences | `shared_preferences` |
| Immutability / serialization | `freezed` + `json_serializable` |
| Functional error handling | `dartz` (`Either<Exception, T>`) |
| Animations | `flutter_animate` |
| i18n | `flutter_localizations` + `intl` + `gen-l10n` |
| Testing | `flutter_test` + `mockito` |

---

## Getting started

**Prerequisites**: Flutter ≥ 3.x, Dart SDK ≥ 3.11

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/tic_tac_toe_flutter.git
cd tic_tac_toe_flutter

# 2. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Generate code (Riverpod, AutoRoute, Drift, Freezed, JSON, l10n)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter gen-l10n

# 4. Run
flutter run
```

---

## Code generation

All generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `*.gr.dart`) are excluded from version control.  
Run the watcher during development:

```bash
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Or use the one-shot build:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

---

## Running tests & coverage

```bash
# All tests
flutter test

# Tests + LCOV coverage report (strips generated files)
make coverage
```

The `make coverage` target runs `scripts/coverage.sh`, which:

1. Executes `flutter test --coverage`
2. Strips generated files from `coverage/lcov.info` with `lcov --remove`
3. Optionally opens an HTML report in your browser (requires `brew install lcov`)

### Test coverage

| Area | Test file |
| --- | --- |
| Database schema | `test/core/database/app_database_test.dart` |
| SharedPreferences service | `test/core/services/shared_preferences/shared_preferences_service_test.dart` |
| Error tracking service | `test/core/services/error_tracking/error_tracking_service_test.dart` |
| GetCpuMoveUsecase (Minimax) | `test/features/game/domain/usecases/get_cpu_move_usecase_test.dart` |
| SaveGameUsecase | `test/features/game/domain/usecases/save_game_usecase_test.dart` |
| GameNotifier | `test/features/game/presentation/providers/game_notifier_test.dart` |
| GetGameHistoryUsecase | `test/features/history/domain/usecases/get_game_history_usecase_test.dart` |
| GameReplayNotifier | `test/features/history/presentation/providers/game_replay_notifier_test.dart` |
| PlayerProfileRepositoryImpl | `test/features/player/data/repositories/player_profile_repository_impl_test.dart` |

The Minimax (`hard` difficulty) is tested with a **"never loses"** property test: 100 games are simulated against a random opponent and O must never lose.

## Code quality — SonarCloud

> **Prerequisites**: `brew install sonar-scanner lcov`

The project is analysed by [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io). Generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `*.gr.dart`, `lib/l10n/`) are excluded from analysis.

### Run locally

```bash
# Export your token once (add to ~/.zshrc to persist)
export SONAR_TOKEN=<your_sonarcloud_token>

# Generate coverage then scan
make ci-quality
# or individually:
make coverage
make sonar
```

### SonarCloud dashboard

## CI/CD — GitHub Actions

The workflow defined in [`.github/workflows/sonar.yml`](.github/workflows/sonar.yml) runs on every push and pull request targeting `main` or `develop`.
